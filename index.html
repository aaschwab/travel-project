            <h3>Madison capitol of Wisconsin</h3>
            <p>
              Madison is the capital city of the state of Wisconsin and the
              county seat of and largest city in Dane County. As of the 2020
              census, the population was 269,840, making it the second-most
              populous city in Wisconsin after Milwaukee, and the 80th-most
              populous in the United States. Madison is named for American
              Founding Father and President James Madison.
            </p>
            <p>
              Located on an isthmus and lands surrounding five lakes—Lake
              Mendota, Lake Monona, Lake Wingra, Lake Kegonsa and Lake
              Waubesa—the city is home to the University of Wisconsin–Madison,
              the Wisconsin State Capitol, the Overture Center for the Arts, and
              the Henry Vilas Zoo. Madison is home to an extensive network of
              parks and bike trails; it has the most parks and playgrounds per
              capita of any of the 100 largest U.S. cities and is one of five
              communities to have received a "Platinum Bicycle Friendly
              Community" rating from the League of American Bicyclists. Madison
              is also home to nine National Historic Landmarks, including
              several buildings designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright, such
              as his 1937 Jacobs I House, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
